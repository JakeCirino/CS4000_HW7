Part 1:
1. Semicolons missing from lines 70 and 72

2. Line 84, the Job constructor used is deprecated. Proper implementation now is Job.getInstance(conf, "Secret Message");

4. "hdfs fsck random_data.txt -files -blocks" shows there are 34 blocks

Part 2:
1. Added the line "conf.set("Message", otherArgs[0]);" in main because it wasn't passing the secret message to the Mapper. Lines 98-100 changed the mapper/reducer class from Mapper.class and Reducer.class (which are the hadoop mapper/reducer) to our implemented mapper/reducer GeneralMapper.class and GeneralReducer.class
